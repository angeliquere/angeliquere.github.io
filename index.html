My Response to As We May Think by Vannevar Bush
</h1>
I found it interesting that there was already an idea for a device that has the same capabilities of storing and accessing information the same way that a modern smartphone does. Bush clearly recognizes the potential of technological devices that had already existed during the time of the article's original writing in 1945â€“ such as the keyboard, and how it was invented in the past but was not efficiently used in 1945. This, alongside a hypothetical machine that makes information easily accessible, is essentially how our devices are built today. The way that Bush talked about accessibility of information through technology was really impressive, accurate, and honestly a bit frightening in its accuracy. He emphasizes how important it is to have individual access to information, which is definitely achieved today. 

Overall I think that this is an insightful and scarily accurate depiction of the future of technology and its impact on society. Bush's argument that a system like the Memex can revolutionize the way that people access and store information through technological means has definitely come into fruition in the present and continues to effect the world through its power.
