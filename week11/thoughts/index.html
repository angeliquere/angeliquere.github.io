        <h1>The Medium is the Massage</h1>
        <p>I really enjoyed this reading and the insight that it has to offer about how media affects our lives, and I find that it is extremely applicable to today's social climate especially with the popularity of social media apps such as Instagram and TikTok. This was also very visually pleasing to look at, and a page that stood out to me was the one about a personal quest for involvement that had a woman vertically standing. This reminded me a lot of Twiggy (a model from the 60s)'s work, so of course I had to put her in my response page. A quote that specifically stood out to me was:</p>
        <div class="quote-box">
          <blockquote>"All media work us over completely. They are so pervasive in their personal, political, economic, aesthetic, psychological, moral, ethical, and social consequences that they leave no part of us untouched, unaffected, unaltered. The medium is the massage. Any understanding of social and cultural change is impossible without a knowledge of the way media work as environments. All media are extensions of some human facultyâ€” psychic or physical."</blockquote>

        <p>This part made me think mostly of the like button on many social media apps. Attention by users has become commodified to create a sense of approval and validation, and in doing so has also created a sort of societal craving for likes and follows, even if they mean nothing beyond just a number in the app. I think about how although I have followers on Instagram, I don't actually know all of them in real life or consider most to be my actual friends. They are merely just numbers on my account to show that I am not lonely.</p>
